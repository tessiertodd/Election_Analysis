# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview
Two Board of Elections employees (Tom & Seth) are looking for some help to calculate some of the key metrics from the election results.
1) Calculate total number of votes.
2) List of candidates with votes.
3) Calculate votes for each candidate.
4) Determine the winner of the election (based on popular vote).

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Sofware: Python 3.6.7, Visual Studio Code 1.60.0

## Summary
The analysis shows the following:
- There were 369,711 votes cast.
- Cadidate names were:
  - Charles Casper Stockham
  - Diana DeGette
  - Raymon Anthony Doane

- Results per candidate:
  - Charles Casper Stockham 23.0% of votes (85,213 votes)
  - Diana DeGette 73.8% of votes (272,892 votes)
  - Raymon Anthony Doane 3.1% of votes (11,606 votes)

- The election winner is:
  - Diana DeGette with 73.8% of votes (272,892 votes)

## Challenge Overview
Election Board needed a little more information.  They wanted to better understand voter turnout by county.

## Challenge Summary
Denver had the largest number of voters out of the total voters by a significant percentage with 82.8% (306,055) of the votes coming from that county.
Jefferson county had 10.5% of voters (38,855) and Arapahoe had 6.7% (24,801).

On additional piece of information that would be helpful would be if we have the number of eligible voters in each county.  With this additional information, we could calculate the % of voter turnout vs. eligible voters which may show which counties had the best voter turnout.
